Exam 5 - Javascript

- We will now experiment on integrating other JS libraries
	to our practice website
- It is recommended that you visit this site as your
	reference: "http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp" and 
	try their examples
	
Exercise/s:

1. Create these Web Pages with the following characteristics:
	a) Use DyGraphs to display a piece-wise function made by
		a linear function and a sinusoid function. (Tip: Use
		JSON for data handling)
	b) Use DyGraphs on your webpage to display the data from
		"gamb.csv". Library can be found from 
		"http://dygraphs.com/"
	c) Add the web plugin named "Disqus" to your web page.
		"https://disqus.com/". Be the first to comment on it.
	d) Display a "page loader animation" when the page is still
		loading (or when Disqus or DyGraphs is still loading).
	e) Organize your website to make it more visually appealing
	f) The website should still be able to auto-scale depending
		on the browser window's size.
